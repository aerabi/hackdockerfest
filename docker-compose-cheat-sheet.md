# Docker Compose Cheat Sheet

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

This cheat sheet is a quick reference for the most common Docker Compose commands and options.

## Installation

Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS. On Linux, you can download Compose as a Docker CLI plugin:

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
```

Please refer to the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) for more Linux installation options.

## Getting Started

To get started with Docker Compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project directory. Here is an example file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
```

Then, run the following command to start the services:

```bash
docker compose up
```



## Basic Commands

Here are some of the most commonly used Docker Compose commands:

- Start services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

- Start services in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- Stop services:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

- Shut down services and remove containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

- View running services:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

- View logs for all services:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

- Execute a command inside a running container:

```bash
docker-compose exec <service_name> <command>
```

## Configuration

The docker-compose.yml file is where you define your services, networks, and volumes. Commonly used configuration options include:

- version: Specifies the version of the Compose file format.
- services: Defines the services (containers) for the application.
- networks: Specifies the networks to be created and used by services.
- volumes: Configures persistent data storage.
- build: Builds the image from a Dockerfile.

Example docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - DEBUG=1
```

## Services

Each service defines a container that runs as part of your application. Here are some key options for defining services:

- image: The Docker image to use (e.g., nginx:alpine).
- build: Path to a directory containing a Dockerfile.
- ports: Exposes ports from the container to the host (e.g., "8080:80").
- volumes: Mounts host paths or named volumes into the container (e.g., ./app:/app).
- environment: Sets environment variables inside the container (e.g., DEBUG=1).
- depends_on: Specifies dependencies between services.

## Volumes

Volumes provide persistent storage for containers. You can define volumes in two ways:

### Named Volumes

Defined in the volumes section of the Compose file and can be reused across services.

```yaml
volumes:
  data_volume:

services:
  app:
    volumes:
      - data_volume:/app/data
```

### Bind Mounts

Maps a directory on the host to a directory inside the container.

```yaml

services:
  app:
    volumes:
      - ./host_dir:/container_dir
```

To list volumes used by Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose volumes ls
```

## Network

Docker Compose automatically creates a default network for your application. You can define custom networks in the docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
networks:
  app_network:

services:
  app:
    networks:
      - app_network
```

Types of networks:

- bridge (default): For isolated networks.
- host: Shares the host's network stack.
- overlay: Used for Docker Swarm services.

## Environment Variables

You can pass environment variables to services using either the environment key or by referencing an external .env file:
Example using the environment key:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - DEBUG=true
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://db:5432/mydb
```

Example using an .env file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    env_file:
      - .env
```

## Logging

You can configure logging drivers for services in Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

To view logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

## Healthchecks

You can define health checks to ensure that services are running properly:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
```  

## Dependencies

To define service startup dependencies, use the depends_on option. Note that this only ensures that containers are started in the correct order, but doesn't guarantee that the dependent service is ready (for this, use health checks):

```yaml
services:
  web:
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
```

## Extensions

Docker Compose extensions allow you to extend existing service definitions by inheriting configuration:

```yaml
services:
  base:
    image: busybox
    volumes:
      - ./shared:/mnt

  app:
    extends:
      service: base
    command: sleep 3600
```

## Include

Docker Compose's `include` feature allows you to import and reuse configuration from other Compose files.
This is useful for modularizing your Compose configurations and avoiding duplication.

```yaml
include:
  - service-b-include.yaml  # serviceB declaration
services:
  serviceA:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - serviceB
```
